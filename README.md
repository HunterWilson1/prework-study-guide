# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation and the reason behind the project was to learn the basics of coding and web development. I hope to find a career in the coding world. It solved the issue of not having a study guide. I learned how to set up the fundamentals I need to start coding and some coding knowledge to put my foot in the door for this bootcamp.
